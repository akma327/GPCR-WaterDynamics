selectKeysGraphicalDisplay.py 
	- Read in a list of interactions that the user wants to visualize and also provide the experiment id
	and replicate id to gain access to the mOR-InteractionOutputDictionary's bit strings. User must 
	specify which interaction types are included in this filtered list to speed up load time. This script
	will display all the interactions within the list for a particular trajectory and topology. Timelapse
	functionality is still there. Will only draw the colored line interactions for the subset of
	interactions.
