dynamic_inter_dict_to_non_state_decomp_unionized_freq.py
- Storing this script here for now to take care of generating the frequencies for particular interaction
and normalizing by total frames. 
- All columns are going to have the same value. I kept this formatting rather than reducing it to one
frequency column so that compile_gprdb_state_decomp_unionized_freq.py wouldn't have to be reformatted.
